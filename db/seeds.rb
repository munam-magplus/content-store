BooksPrimaryContentInformation.where(id:17230	).last.update_attributes(book_blurb:"		This extensive book discusses various problems related to water stress as well as management in plants. Water stress in plants occurs when the transpiration rate becomes severe, or when the supply of water to their roots gets restricted and the central reason for this phenomenon is water deficit, for example, high soil salinity or drought. Every year, water stress in arable plants in distinct areas of the world obstructs the supply of food and disturbs agriculture, ultimately leading to famine. Therefore, the ability to endure such stress is of extreme economic significance. Plants attempt to adjust to the stress circumstances with a collection of biochemical and physiological interventions. This book consists of contributions made by authors from across the world and provides a comprehensive picture on the mechanism and adaptation aspects of water stress. The main aim of this book is to provide a thoughtful collection of viewpoints which will serve as a valuable source of reference for workers in all fields of plant sciences.

From oil and gas exploitation, to mining and manufacturing, various fields have generated critical problems in technological development due to surfaces. With time, there has been development of new techniques which have served as avenues for enhancing surface properties like abrasion, wear rate and corrosion resistance. Some of the latest advancements in surface engineering have been discussed in this book.")
