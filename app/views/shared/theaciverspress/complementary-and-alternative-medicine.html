The treatment involves undergoing a course of needles that are inserted to specific points. This therapy originated in traditional Chinese medicine. This book on acupuncture deals with the various therapies, ancient and modern, that have become popular among practitioners. Different remedies have different effects on the muscles according to the acuteness of the pain and the general condition of the patient have also been discussed. Case studies that reflect the varied ways in which acupuncture can be applied are elucidated in this book. Coherent flow of topics, student-friendly language and extensive use of examples make this book an invaluable source of knowledge.
